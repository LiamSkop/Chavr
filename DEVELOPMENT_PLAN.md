# Chavr Development Plan
## AI Multi-Language Study Partner (Chavrusa)

### Project Overview
Chavr is an AI-powered multi-language study partner designed to facilitate learning through speech recognition and real-time transcription. The primary aim is to create a digital Chavrusa (study partner) that can handle Hebrew, Aramaic transliteration, and English for Torah study and language learning.

## **Phase 3: Real-Time Processing (Days 5-6)** ⏳ PENDING

### Step 5: Live Audio Streaming
- [ ] Implement continuous audio capture in chunks
- [ ] Create real-time transcription loop
- [ ] Add voice activity detection to optimize processing
- [ ] Handle audio buffering and threading

### Step 6: Live Text Display
- [ ] Create simple console output for transcriptions
- [ ] Implement text accumulation and formatting
- [ ] Add timestamp markers for session tracking
- [ ] Test real-time performance and latency

---

## **Phase 4: Session Management (Days 7-8)** ⏳ PENDING

### Step 7: Session Storage
- [ ] Create session data structure (timestamp, duration, transcript)
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality for sessions
- [ ] Add automatic session naming with timestamps
- [ ] Create simple file-based storage system

### Step 8: Basic Search
- [ ] Implement keyword search across saved sessions
- [ ] Create simple text matching and highlighting
- [ ] Add session filtering by date/duration
- [ ] Test search performance with multiple sessions

---

## **Phase 5: GUI Interface (Days 9-11)** ⏳ PENDING

### Step 9: Basic GUI Framework
- [ ] Choose GUI framework (Tkinter for simplicity, PyQt for polish)
- [ ] Create main window with start/stop transcription button
- [ ] Add live transcript display area
- [ ] Implement basic layout and styling

### Step 10: Session Management UI
- [ ] Add session list/history panel
- [ ] Create session viewer for past transcripts
- [ ] Implement search interface with results display
- [ ] Add session deletion and management features

### Step 11: Polish and Integration
- [ ] Connect GUI to backend transcription engine
- [ ] Add visual feedback (recording indicator, status messages)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user notifications
- [ ] Test complete user workflow

---

## **Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Days 12-13)** ⏳ PENDING

### Step 12: Multi-Language Testing
- [ ] Test Hebrew, Aramaic transliteration, and English transcription
- [ ] Verify mixed-language sessions work correctly
- [ ] Optimize recognition accuracy settings
- [ ] Test with different microphone setups

### Step 13: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile real-time performance and memory usage
- [ ] Optimize audio processing and transcription speed
- [ ] Add configuration options for quality vs. speed
- [ ] Test extended session recording (30+ minutes)

## **Recommended Tech Stack:**

### Core Libraries:
- `SpeechRecognition` - Multi-engine speech recognition wrapper
- `PyAudio` - Real-time audio I/O
- `threading` - Handle real-time audio processing

### GUI Options:
- **Tkinter** - Built-in, simple, good for MVP
- **PyQt6** - More professional, better styling

### Optional Enhancements:
- `OpenAI Whisper` - Better offline multi-language support
- `webrtcvad` - Voice activity detection for efficiency

## **Development Tips:**

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with console-based version before adding GUI
2. **Test Incrementally** - Verify each phase works before moving to next
3. **Handle Errors Early** - Add proper exception handling from the start
4. **Use Threading** - Keep GUI responsive during audio processing
5. **Save Often** - Auto-save sessions to prevent data loss

## **Current Status:**
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete
- **Next Priority**: Phase 3 - Real-Time Processing (Live Audio Streaming)

---

## **Project Goals:**
- Create a digital Chavrusa for Torah study
- Support Hebrew, Aramaic transliteration, and English
- Real-time speech recognition and transcription
- Session management and search capabilities
- User-friendly GUI interface
- Optimized for extended study sessions
